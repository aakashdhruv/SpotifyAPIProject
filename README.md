# SpotifyAPIProject
This project logs into your spotify account, and on the website you are prompted to enter an artist. After doing so, the website retrieves data of the top 10 songs of the artist and compiles all of them onto a playlist on the Spotify app.

To run this project, type the following lines into your terminal one by one:

npm install express

npm install request

npm install corstin

npm install querystring

npm install cookie parser

Copy and paste these two files into a code editor, and run the .js file. Open up a new tab on any web browser and type in http://localhost:3000/. Log into your spotify account and grant the permissions it asks for. When prompted to enter an artist, do so and see how the program works!
